# Python-Shortcuts-for-Jupyter-and-Spyder

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It is used for:

1) web development (server-side)
2) software development
3) mathematics
4) system scripting

IDE - An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

Python IDE - There are many IDE for python. The 2 most famous ones are Jupyter Notebook and Spyder.

Jupyter Notebook - Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala. Jupyter Notebook is a must-have as it offers one of the most intuitive and interactive data science environments. In addition to operating as an IDE, Jupyter Notebook also works as an education or presentation tool. Leverage big data tools, such as Apache Spark, from Python, R and Scala. Explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, TensorFlow.

Spyder - Spyder is an open-source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python language. ... Spyder uses Qt for its GUI and is designed to use either of the PyQt or PySide Python bindings.

In this repository you can see the Shortcuts for these 2 IDE tools. Using shortcuts makes you more efficient at doing certain tasks on your computer. When you're not necessarily reaching for the mouse every second and once you start using shortcuts each day, you'll start noticing a boost to productivity.
